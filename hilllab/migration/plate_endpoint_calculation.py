        minutes (int): number of minutes in the desired timepoint

        bundle (migration.Bundle): The data bundle to be used if not
            loading from a path. 
        data_type (string): Specifies the type model used to collect the 
            data. Options include 'SPE' (default), 'TEC', and 'PRE'.

            within the plate_kinetic_calculation() function. This affects
            some minor data handling decisions.

            them based on given time values.
