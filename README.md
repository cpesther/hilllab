# Welcome to the hilllab Python Library
This library contains code written by Christopher Esther starting in July 2025. 

### autotracker module
The standard autotracker used by the Hill Lab for PTMR and MCT assays. Based on origial code written by Matt Markovetz in September 2016. Rebuilt in July 2025 to address various performance issues and create a more standardized and well-documented VRPN format. 

### beads module
A collection of assay-independent functions used to analyze and visualize bead movement and other properties. Based on some existing MatLab scripts redesigned here in Python. 

### cilia module
Functions related to cilia-based assays, including mucociliary transport (MCT). Certain concepts based on code written by Matthew Combs in May 2015.

### interfaces module
Jupyter notebook files to be used as the "user interfaces" for interacting with various codebases included here. No special functionality besides prompts and tutorials. 

### migration module
Processing and analysis code for the one dimensional migration assay (1DMA or 1D). This is the most recent version of the 1DMA codebase written by Christopher Esther beginning in December 2022.

### utilities module
A random collection of functions that serve "supporting" roles in other modules. Most are not implemented and are generally intended for use during development, but they are still worth keeping around.
