    Captures a memory allocation snapshot using tracemalloc and dumps

        breakpoint (str): a value that can be added to the file name
            to more clearly indicate where the snapshot is being taken.
        active (bool): allows us to "turn off" monitoring easily when

            this function within a conditional.
